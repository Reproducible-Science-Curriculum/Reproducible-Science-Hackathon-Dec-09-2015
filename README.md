## 2nd Reproducible Science Hackathon for curriculum and material development
Almost to the day one year after the [first event](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/) we will be holding the 2nd Reproducible Science Hackathon. Targets for the event include but are not limited to translating the R-specific material to Python; refactoring and refinement of the existing material to increase the possibilities for reuse by mix-and-match; addressing common feedback from the workshops that have been taught; and the development of more advanced modules (such as on using Docker).

### Logistics
* **Location:** [iDigBio](http://idigbio.org), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL
* **Dates:** December 9, 9am to December 10, 6pm, 2015

### How to participate
Space constraints will limit onsite participants to about 15, and onsite participation is therefore by invitation only. Full instructions are [posted in the planning repo](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/planning/issues/2).
