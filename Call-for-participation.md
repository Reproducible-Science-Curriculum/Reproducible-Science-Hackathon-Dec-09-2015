## 2nd Reproducible Science Hackathon for curriculum and material development
Almost to the day one year after the [first event](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-08-2014/) we will be holding the 2nd Reproducible Science Hackathon. Targets for the event include but are not limited to translating the R-specific material to Python; refactoring and refinement of the existing material to increase the possibilities for reuse by mix-and-match; addressing common feedback from the workshops that have been taught; and the development of more advanced modules (such as on using Docker).

### Logistics
* **Location:** [iDigBio](http://idigbio.org), University of Florida, Gainesville, FL
* **Dates:** December 9, 9am to December 10, 6pm, 2015

### How to participate
Space constraints will limit onsite participants to about 15, and onsite participation is therefore by invitation only. 

If you would like to participate, please post the target or idea you would like to work on as an issue on the [hackathon repository](https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-09-2015), and label it with _work target_, or add yourself to an [existing one](
https://github.com/Reproducible-Science-Curriculum/Reproducible-Science-Hackathon-Dec-09-2015/labels/work%20target) by indicating (in the form of a comment) your desire to collaborate on the target. Please also fill out the [online application form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MoON73L7HsK1Ee5O5y-WOZVR_x57KrLq8FcY2uWx75Q/viewform); please do so even if you participated in the first hackathon and we know of your interest in attending this one, because it allows us to accurately keep track of participants.

Funding is available to support travel expenses. Please be sure to indicate your need of travel support in the online application form.

Review of applications will be on a rolling basis starting immediately until seats are filled. Because we are not planning orientation activities to familiarize participants with reproducibility issues in general or the Reproducible Science Curriculum in particular, preference will be given to applicants who have participated in Reproducible Science Curriculum activities in the past, or who can demonstrate that they will likely be productive at the event without such orientation. Depending on airfares, applicants requiring travel support may be not be considered after Nov 1.
